# Artwork Helper

Artwork Helper provides skins a few options for building a list of images for a `multiimage`
or list control from images available via InfoLabels. Skins can display them without an
add-on, but this makes it a bit easier.
This is a small add-on that skins can use as a dependency, only doing what a skin asks it to do.

Current version only works for Kodi 17 and 18, see tagged version 0.7.1 for 15 and 16.

## Add-on setting

There is an add-on setting to pull extrafanart and extrathumbs from the filesystem, if there is
only a single image in the library. It is off by default, but can be turned on by the end user/viewer.
This setting is not needed if Artwork Beef is used to manage artwork.
It can be found by navigating to Kodi settings -> System settings -> Add-ons -> Manage dependencies -> Artwork Helper,
or for Jarvis and earlier open Kodi settings -> Add-ons -> System -> Dependencies -> Artwork Helper.
The Settings level may need to be set to Advanced to see dependencies in Add-ons.
